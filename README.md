### Hi there üëã

My name is Edidiong Asikpo. I am a Software Developer and Content Creator who currently works as a Developer Advocate at Hashnode.

I've given over 50+ talks at various tech conferences/meetups across the world and played a significant part in building 3 of the most impactful developer communities in Africa: Developer Circle Uyo from Facebook, Open Source Community Africa, and She Code Africa.

I make coding/technical writing contributions to Open Source organizations like Wikimedia, VideoLAN, and Open Data Kit.

Due to my contributions to building the developer ecosystem in Africa, I was named an ‚ÄúIcon of Change‚Äù by Facebook. I was also the first and only technical writer from Africa to be accepted into the Google Season of Docs in 2019.
